# Lambda intro

A lambda is made up of 3 parts: -

- Parameters. One or more parameters.
- Arrow operator ->, separating parameter and body
- Body. One or more lines of code

e.g. (a) -> a.getType()

## Parameters

Rules:-

- If there is more than one parameter, parentheses are required.
- Parameters do not have to be typed.
- If a type is present, parentheses are required.

## Body

Rules:-

- If a body is a single statement, then no braces are needed
- If braces are present, the `return` keyword is needed
- If braces are present, a semi-colon is needed
